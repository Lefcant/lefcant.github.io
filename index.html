            <p>Hi! I'm Leonidas Canterakis. My formative years were spent in a culturally diverse environment in Germany, where I received an international education at the French-German secondary school (Deutsch-Französisches Gymnasium) in Freiburg im Breisgau. This unique educational setting not only provided me with a solid foundation in multiple languages but also fostered a deep appreciation for learning. Following this enriching experience, I delved into the world of linguistics and Greek/Classical studies, first in Athens and then at the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität of Munich. Navigating the intricacies of language and how it has historically developed has been a very interesting journey.</p>
            <p>My interests are quite varied, spanning science, philosophy, mathematics, language, music and other fields. I have a particular affinity for the philosophies of Karl Popper and David Deutsch, whose ideas have profoundly influenced my approach to critical thinking and the pursuit of knowledge. Then there's my love for the English language and culture—there's something about its history and literature that captivates me. I also recreationally play the guitar, finding comfort and expression in music and song. It's this mix of interests that keeps me exploring and learning, always eager to see where curiosity will lead me next.</p>
