                This graph shows the increase of global GDP since the 1st century AD with a stark inflection point around the Age of Enlightenment. Prior to this intellectual renaissance, the trajectory of global GDP was relatively flat, indicating a state of near-permanent poverty and economic stagnation.
                <br /><br />
                The Enlightenment, taking place around the time between the 17th and 19th centuries, marked a shift in human thought and social organization whose importance can hardly be overstated. The dissemination of Enlightenment ideals—critical inquiry, and the fresh confidence in human reason—undermined feudal paradigms and brought about the advent of political and economic liberalism. The propagation of scientific thinking and scepticism about traditional dogma caused a flurry of technological innovations and improvements in agricultural productivity.
                <br /><br />
                Simultaneously, the Industrial Revolution, beginning in Britain, orchestrated an unprecedented escalation in production efficiency. The augmentation of mechanization and the advent of factories led to a surge in output, enabling economies to transcend all ceilings known until then.
                <br /><br />
                Although the graph includes only economic output explicitly, the latter also represents an awakening in all other areas of thought and human flourishing as well as the discovery of entirely new ones.
                <br /><br />
                This is one of my favourite graphs because it so powerfully distills in one image our ability to escape stagnation and make potentially unbounded progress. Since the Enlightenment, we know how.
